    <h1>Ankle Sprains</h1>
<p><strong>Ankle Sprains:</strong> These happen when ligaments in the ankle are stretched or torn, often caused by sudden twisting or rolling — something very likely during an earthquake thanks to unstable ground, debris, or falling objects. Sprains can range from mild to severe, including full ligament tears.</p>

<p><strong>First Aid:</strong> Rest the ankle and avoid putting weight on it.</p>

<p>Apply ice or a cold pack wrapped in cloth for 15–20 minutes every 1–2 hours for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain.</p>

<p>Wrap the ankle with an elastic compression bandage to control swelling. Don’t wrap it too tight — you don’t want to cut off circulation. Elevate the foot above heart level when possible.</p>

<p>Take acetaminophen for pain relief. Avoid heat, alcohol, and massage during the first 48 hours, as they can make swelling worse.</p>

<p>Seek medical attention if you can’t put weight on the ankle, if swelling gets worse, or if you heard a pop when it happened — this could mean a serious tear or fracture.</p>
