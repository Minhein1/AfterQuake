   <h1>Simple Fractures</h1>
<p>A simple fracture is a clean bone break that doesnâ€™t pierce the skin, often caused by falling debris during earthquakes.</p>

<p><strong>First Aid Steps:</strong></p>
<p>Keep the limb still and do not try to straighten it. Use a splint (like a stick or rolled paper) to stabilize, tying it gently. Apply a cold pack wrapped in cloth to reduce swelling.</p>

<p>Watch for swelling, bruising, or limited movement. If signs of shock appear, help the person lie down and stay calm.</p>

<p>All fractures require medical care. Avoid giving food or drink in case surgery is needed. Call emergency services or go to the hospital immediately.</p>

<p>Seek medical help if pain, swelling, or deformity is severe.</p>
