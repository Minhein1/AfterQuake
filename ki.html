    <h1>Knee Injuries</h1>
<p>Knee injuries from earthquakes often happen due to falls or twists. They include sprains (ligament damage) and bruises to muscles or soft tissue.</p>

<p><strong>First Aid Steps:</strong></p>
<p>Rest the knee and avoid putting weight on it. Apply ice wrapped in cloth for 15–20 minutes every 1–2 hours for the first 48 hours to reduce swelling.</p>

<p>Use a compression wrap or brace for support, but not too tight. Elevate the leg above heart level to reduce swelling.</p>

<p>Take pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Start gentle movement once pain lessens, but avoid heavy activity until healed.</p>

<p>See a doctor if the injury is severe, you can’t walk, or the knee feels unstable or looks deformed.</p>
