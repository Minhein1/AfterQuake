    <h1>Wrist Sprains</h1>
   <p><strong>Wrist Sprains:</strong> These occur when wrist ligaments are stretched or torn, often from falling on an outstretched hand, sudden twisting, or direct impact. Earthquakes can trigger these injuries through falls, debris, or awkward movements during evacuation.</p>

<p><strong>First Aid:</strong> Rest the wrist and avoid using it for any activity that causes pain.</p>

<p>Apply ice or a cold pack wrapped in cloth for 15–20 minutes every 1–2 hours during the first 48 hours to reduce swelling and pain.</p>

<p>Use a compression bandage or wrist brace to support the joint. Make sure it’s snug but not too tight. Elevate the wrist above heart level when possible to minimize swelling.</p>

<p>Take acetaminophen for pain relief. Avoid heat and massage during the first 48 hours as they can worsen swelling.</p>

<p>Seek medical care if there’s intense pain, difficulty moving the wrist, numbness, or ongoing swelling — these could signal a fracture or serious tear.</p>
