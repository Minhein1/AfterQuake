    <h1>Minor Head Injuries</h1>
   <p><strong>Minor Head Injuries:</strong> These include bumps, bruises, or small cuts from impact during an earthquake. They usually heal on their own but require monitoring for serious symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>First Aid:</strong> Clean cuts with water and cover with a sterile dressing. Apply a cold compress to reduce swelling and pain.</p>

<p>Watch for confusion, vomiting, drowsiness, or behavior changes. Seek immediate medical help if these occur.</p>

<p>Rest for at least 24 hours. Use acetaminophen for pain, but avoid aspirin or NSAIDs early on.</p>

<p>Get medical attention if symptoms worsen or donâ€™t improve. Serious signs include repeated vomiting, trouble waking, confusion, weakness, uneven pupils, or seizures.</p>
