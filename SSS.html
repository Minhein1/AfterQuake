    <h1>Shoulder Strains and Sprains</h1>
<p>These injuries happen when shoulder muscles or ligaments are stretched or torn, often from falls or sudden moves during earthquakes.</p>

<p><strong>First Aid Steps:</strong></p>
<p>Rest the shoulder and avoid lifting. Apply ice wrapped in cloth for 15–20 minutes several times daily for 48 hours to ease swelling and pain.</p>

<p>Use a sling to limit movement if needed. Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain and inflammation.</p>

<p>Once pain decreases, start gentle exercises to restore motion. Avoid heavy activities until fully healed.</p>

<p>See a doctor if swelling is severe, there’s numbness, deformity, or loss of movement.</p>
